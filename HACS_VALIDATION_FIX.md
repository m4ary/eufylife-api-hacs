# HACS Validation Fix Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Integration Manifest Issue - FIXED
**Error**: `required key not provided @ data['issue_tracker']`

**Solution**: Added the missing `issue_tracker` field to `manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "domain": "eufylife_api",
  "name": "EufyLife API",
  "codeowners": ["@m4ary"],
  "config_flow": true,
  "documentation": "https://github.com/m4ary/eufylife-api-hacs",
  "issue_tracker": "https://github.com/m4ary/eufylife-api-hacs/issues",
  "integration_type": "device",
  "iot_class": "cloud_polling",
  "requirements": ["requests>=2.25.0"],
  "version": "1.1.1"
}
```

## 🔧 Remaining Issues to Fix

### 2. ❌ Repository Topics Issue
**Error**: `The repository has no valid topics`

**Solution**: Add topics to your GitHub repository manually:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/m4ary/eufylife-api-hacs
2. Click the **⚙️ gear icon** next to "About" section (top right)
3. In the "Topics" field, add these relevant topics:
   ```
   home-assistant
   hacs
   integration
   eufy
   eufylife
   smart-scale
   health
   fitness
   weight-tracking
   home-automation
   ```
4. Click **"Save changes"**

**Alternative via GitHub CLI** (if you have it installed):
```bash
gh repo edit m4ary/eufylife-api-hacs --add-topic "home-assistant,hacs,integration,eufy,eufylife,smart-scale,health,fitness,weight-tracking,home-automation"
```

### 3. ⚠️ Brands Repository Warning (Optional)
**Warning**: `The repository has not been added as a custom domain to the brands repo`

**Explanation**: This is **normal** for custom integrations. This warning occurs because:
- Your integration uses the domain `eufylife_api`
- But the existing brands repo has `eufylife_ble` (different domain)
- HACS checks if custom integrations have been added to the official brands repository

**Solutions** (choose one):

#### Option A: Keep Local Brand Assets (Current Setup - Recommended)
- ✅ You already have the EufyLife brand assets in `custom_components/eufylife_api/brands/`
- ✅ This works perfectly for custom integrations
- ✅ No additional action needed

#### Option B: Submit to Official Brands Repository
1. Fork the [home-assistant/brands](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands) repository
2. Create `custom_integrations/eufylife_api/` folder
3. Copy your brand assets there:
   - `icon.png` (256×256)
   - `icon@2x.png` (512×512)
4. Submit a pull request

**Recommendation**: Keep the local brand assets (Option A) as it's simpler and works perfectly.

## 🎯 Final HACS Validation Status

After fixing the topics issue, your validation should show:

```
✅ Description: completed
✅ Archived: completed  
✅ Issues: completed
✅ Information: completed
✅ Topics: completed (after adding topics)
✅ HACS JSON: completed
✅ Integration Manifest: completed (fixed)
⚠️ Brands: warning (expected for custom integrations)
```

**Result**: 7/8 checks passed (1 warning is normal)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add topics to GitHub repository** (see instructions above)
2. **Commit and push** the manifest.json changes
3. **Re-run HACS validation** to verify fixes
4. **Submit to HACS** if all validations pass
