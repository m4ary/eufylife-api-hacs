## Supported Devices

- EufyLife Smart Scale P3 (T9150)
- Other EufyLife smart scales connected to the EufyLife app

## Sensors Created

For each family member, the integration creates the following sensors:

- **Weight** (kg) - Current weight measurement
- **Target Weight** (kg) - Weight goal
- **Body Fat** (%) - Body fat percentage  
- **Muscle Mass** (kg) - Muscle mass measurement
- **BMI** (kg/m¬≤) - Body Mass Index

## Device Information

Each family member appears as a separate device in Home Assistant with:
- Device name: "EufyLife Customer [ID]"
- Manufacturer: EufyLife
- Model: Smart Scale
- Last update timestamp

## API Details

This integration uses the official EufyLife API endpoints:
- Authentication: `POST /v1/user/v2/email/login`
- Weight data: `GET /v1/customer/all_target`
- Detailed data: `GET /v1/customer/target/{customer_id}`

## Privacy & Security

- Credentials are stored securely in Home Assistant's encrypted storage
- Access tokens are automatically managed and refreshed
- All API communication uses HTTPS
- No data is shared with third parties

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your EufyLife email and password
   - Ensure your account has access to smart scale data

2. **No Data Available**
   - Check that your smart scale is connected to the EufyLife app
   - Ensure you have recent measurements

3. **Sensors Not Updating**
   - Check the Home Assistant logs for API errors
   - Verify your internet connection

### Debug Logging
